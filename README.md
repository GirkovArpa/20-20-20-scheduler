- [x] For Windows 10 PC

- [x] No monetary payment required to get the software

- [x] Program can be opened as a window; this window has the settings that I request

The program works this way:

1. - [x] Log into Windows 10 PC to start the reminder system (copy executable to shell:startup)

2. - [x] If logged in, start a timer countdown (amount of time specified in settings) (see above)

3. - [x] If timer reaches zero, display a window message (small box with easy to read text)

4. - [x] Reset timer and start it again once the message box is closed. Do this while the PC is logged in.

5. - [x] The reminder system's settings can be changed by opening an (easy to use) app

Reminder system settings:

1. - [x] Adjust, in seconds, how long the timer lasts

2. - [x] Change the text of the message that pops up after the timer ends

3. - [x] A setting where the message that pops up cannot be x-ed out until a certain number of seconds pass. The number of seconds for this setting should be adjustable.

4. - [x] The ability to disable all of the above settings and to uninstall the program.

5. - [x] The ability to test the reminder to see if the message pops up on demand (immediately). Or something that can test whether the reminder system actually works the way it should.

Additional:

1. - [x] the message box should not be minimizable. It has to appear in the center of the screen. The text of the message box is bold, black text in a white message box.
